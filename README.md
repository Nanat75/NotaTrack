# 🧾 NotaTrack — Operational Logging System
### *An internship-built inventory & document management solution*

</div>

> **Status:** ✅ Completed — Official Internship Project

---

## 🏢 Overview

**NotaTrack** is the **official project** I developed during my internship.  
Unlike personal experiments, this system was built by **directly following company requirements**, with a focus on improving **inventory logging** and **document management**.

The main objective was to:
> **Reduce manual errors, streamline daily operations, and organize data more effectively.**

NotaTrack is designed to be **practical, structured, and reliable** for real operational use.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Before NotaTrack, daily operational data was:
- Logged manually
- Scattered across documents
- Prone to human error

NotaTrack centralizes these processes into a **single, structured system**, helping staff work faster and with greater accuracy.
